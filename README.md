# FES_Mock_Site
This project is the creation of a Frontend Simplified (FES) mock website. I am in the FES online bootcamp. The mock site uses HTML5, CSS, Flexbox, and Media Queries. I deleted the Discord section given in the online classroom example, and added a Community section and a Staff Message Board section. I added images made from FES sites using the Snipping Tool. I added a Top anchor tag and background colors for the added sections. I deleted the Latin filler text and wrote valid information. All images have the alt tag.
